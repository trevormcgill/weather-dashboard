# Weather Dashboard

## Description
In this challenge, I had to create a weather dashboard that would display weather data for different cities. To accomplish this, I used fetch requests using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data. To allow users to easily access weather data for previously searched cities, I used local storage to save search history and created buttons with event listeners to display the weather data when clicked. In addition, I included a five-day forecast below the current day's forecast to provide users with a comprehensive overview of the weather conditions for the next few days.
